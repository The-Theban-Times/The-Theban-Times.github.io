				&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; The people of Thebes are sad to announce the death of a very important member of the royal family: Jocasta. She was many things, The Queen of Thebes, the spouse and mother of King Oedipus, and the widow of King Laius. All of the queen’s troubles began when she married the cursed Prince Laius.  </P>

<!-- <p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Last night, in the royal palace a series of tragic events unfolded in a single day. This ended up with our cunning King Oedipus blinded and abandoning his kingdom, beloved Queen Jocasta dead, and ambiguity in the air, leaving his children orphaned. This series of events leaves many questions for his subjects: Who will rule? Are they qualified? What really unfolded and why? </P>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; The story starts after Oedipus is enraged by the results of the prophecy given to him by the soothsayer Tiresias. He was suggested to send for Tiresias by Creon to resolve the plague on our land. He was blinded by his rage and believes that his brother-in-law Creon sent Tiresias in an effort to kill him and take the throne. Creon of course thought this opinion was foolish and selfish and led to Queen Jocasta having to step in. She explained to him that he should not trust Tiresias and not be angered by Creon. It seems that Oedipus' thoughts may be caused by his ill temper. </p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; There was one thing that Tiresias said that resonated with Oedipus. He needed to find the person who killed our late king Laius. The only problem was that the details of Laius’ death were still misty. He had gone on a trip and was killed at the three-way crossroads just before the timely arrival of Oedipus. Unfortunately, Tiresias and Jocasta’s advice subtly hinted that it was Oedipus who killed the king. Oedipus had left his family at Corinth and had killed a man along the way as an act of self-defense. What if that man was our beloved king Laius?</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Hoping that he wasn’t the murderer of the king of his kingdom he wanted to search for the shepherd who had survived the murder scene but was discouraged by Jocasta. Later on, a messenger came to deliver some bad news to Oedipus, his father, Polybus had died. Oedipus was sad but in an effort to cheer him up the messenger revealed that Polybus and Merope of Corinth were not in fact his true parents. He was given to the messenger by Laius’s very own servant. Oedipus decided he wanted to find this servant but Jocasta pleaded with him not to. He ignored her and proceeded. The story seemed to have troubled Jocasta and she left the scene frustrated. </p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; As it turns out both shepherds Laius was looking for were the same person. He begged the shepherd for answers to his questions and he discovered a truth that shocked him. The baby he gave to the messenger was the son of Laius. That meant that he was the son of Laius. After unveiling this truth Oedipus fled to the palace where he found an unsightly scene.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Oedipus opened the locked bedroom door of his wife. From a noose was her limp body miserably hanging lifeless. He embraced the body and he was overwhelmed with hate and guilt for his actions. He felt that the gods believed he did not deserve a fate so kind as death. He unpinned the broach from Jocasta’s robe and stabbed his eyes, cursing himself with the fate of blindness for eternity. He ran out into public with his damaged eyes. He told Creon that his sons would rule the kingdom but he cared for his daughters. Oedipus made sure he was exiled from Thebes and his whereabouts were unknown.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Former Oedipus the King blind, he and his family were publicly shamed, and  the kingdom abandoned. He revealed a story so tragic and blasphemous, setting another curse on this kingdom. He left his sons who are still young to rule our kingdom. </p>


<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Who knows what will happen next, will the gods ever grant us peace?</p>-->

			<td  style="width:50%">Did Oedipus Make the Correct Choice?
			<p style=" font-weight :Bold"><i> By Sumati Gurram </i></p>
			<p style="font-weight:normal">
			How can we say that Oedipus made the right decision? Making decisions is an important part of everyones’ lives and Oedipus had to make some difficult ones as well. Crossroads and choices are shown significantly throughout this journey.

			 <p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; How can we say that Oedipus made the right decision? Making decisions is an important part of everyones’ lives and Oedipus had to make some difficult ones as well. Crossroads and choices are shown significantly throughout this journey. Oedipus is an extremely indecisive person, however, he did make some important decisions throughout his life to find the truth. I believe that Oedipus made many incorrect choices leading to his path of finding the truth.</P>
			 
	<!--<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;As a person who is a part of this kingdom, I believe that many of our problems could’ve been avoided if someone had advised King Oedipus to make better decisions. I understand that he was adamant about learning the truth about his father and the reason for his birth, but as a result, he caused tremendous problems and spread war throughout Thebes. Everyone has personal problems in their lives but as the King of our kingdom Oedipus’ duty was to put everything aside and make his kingdom his number one priority. This didn’t happen and it caused civil war resulting in even more conflict. </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Oedipus is a very determined person and that is why the constant theme of persistence in finding the truth is shown greatly throughout his journey. From the beginning of Oedipus Rex, he determines that he will seek out King Laius' killer. Oedipus spends the majority of the play searching for the culprit, even though Tiresias told him that it was Oedipus himself who committed the murder. Finally, near the end of the story, Oedipus discovers enough evidence to figure out the truth on his own. </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Another theme that is shown evidently throughout Oedipus’ journey is the power fate holds whereas the way free will can turn someone's life. I believe that the Oracle of Delphi was incorrect and Oedipus’ decision to continue on this personal journey brought tremendous downfall to the entire kingdom. Oedipus’ past was important for his own life but as a citizen of Thebes, I can confidently speak on the behalf of the people of Thebes and say there were multiple negative consequences as rumors spread of the Oracle of Delphi. </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;The main conflict in this play is between Fate and Free Choice. Uncontrollable forces such as fate exist. It was thought that a person's life was predetermined before birth. Zeus himself could not resist his own will due to how strong fate is. Nonetheless, the Greeks also placed a great deal of value on the idea of free choice. Oedipus' prophecy consequently "self-fulfills" itself. During the journey, he has complete freedom to decide how to behave. Ironically, Oedipus ends up experiencing the tragic outcome of his decisions. </p>
	
	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
	In conclusion, the journey of Oedipus with him finding the truth about what happened to his father has many pathways. The major themes and morals shown throughout his story were the impact of fate and free will throughout one's life, and how persistence in finding the truth can change the way a family is oriented.  </p>-->
