        <td>Dear Tiresias, 

I am an average man who works longer than the normal 9 - 5 in the fields from dawn to dusk. I have been working like this for a long time because as any normal Greek wants I want my family to have the best. My hands are tired and my back hurts from this work. The worst part is I never told my family that I have been working this hard. Since I’ve started I snuck out early in the morning and pretended I was at a friends for drinks. Nobody suspected anything. I haven’t told them because I have been saving my money and we are very poor. I know the importance but I didn’t know if they do. The problem is my daughter and wife want to go see the latest drama but if I tell them we can easily afford it, who knows what else they will ask for. I am saving up to move to get a better job and if they know they may be selfish and not care.
Sincerely, 
Foolish Farmer

Dear Foolish Farmer,
First I would like to say that I condemn you for lying to your family. Blindness is the cruelest punishment and you have just placed it on your loved ones. It may not be clear now but wisdom is the greatest gift of all but a hard one to give. Wisdom can only benefit your family, otherwise, all the work you have labored for will be as menial as a rat hunting a deer. Hard work is an appreciated sentiment but for thanks to be given it must be shown to light. In addition, trust is something that is not seen but built and to be built it must be given.

Sincerely, 
Tiresias

 <td>Dear Tiresias,
I am but a boy of twelve years old but I have big dreams. I am from a family of craftsmen and my father expects me to follow in his footsteps. He is trying to teach me the way of shoe making and he expects me to carry on the legacy of the best shoemakers in a visible distance. I honestly do not believe him because why would we be living in such a humble abode if we were? It may seem like I am being over dramatic but every time I touch the leather I know I don’t belong, I belong elsewhere. I want to contribute to the people but not this way. I want to be the greatest poet to ever exist. I want to write words that bring people to tears. The problem is my family thinks that most people don’t make it as poets and that I am going to run myself into a wall but they just don’t see the inner light shining from inside of me. 

Sincerely, 
Stuck Shoemaker

Dear Stuck Shoemaker,
One's true destiny does not lie within but in the hands of the fates. There are stories of people changing their destinies but I do not see you having a long twisted path. Oedipus the king tried to escape his faith but it ended up stabbing him in the back. If your talent had been recognized I may have said to go off your journey as a shoemaker but unfortunately, it has not. The wisdom your father has given you is a gift and you should use it.

Sincerely, Tiresias

        <td>Dear Tirseias,
I am an average Theban woman who works at my house and takes care of my children. I always thought I was doing everything right. So if I am doing everything right why does my family seem to be falling apart? My husband is at work all day and sometimes he's not even home at night. How could he even go to work for so long? His answers are always vague. What if he’s cheating on me? He claims he works hard for his family but he can’t even afford to take my daughter and I to a drama that many citizens attend. I need help finding out what he is really up to.

Sincerely, Worried Wife

Dear Worried Wife

	Wisdom is a delicate thing. How much is it worth if it holds no purpose to the beholder? How terrible may it be if it is hurting the beholder? How helpful can it be if your life is enjoyable now? Sometimes too much knowledge is harmful but if it should be given it will be. I suggest patience will do you good but also train the mind to be sharp but uncut. Blindness can be a gift but also a curse.
Sincerely, 
Tiresias</td>
