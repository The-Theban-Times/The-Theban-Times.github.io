		<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; How can we say that Oedipus made the right decision? Making decisions is an important part of everyones’ lives and Oedipus had to make some difficult ones as well. Crossroads and choices are shown significantly throughout this journey. Oedipus is an extremely indecisive person, however, he did make some important decisions throughout his life to find the truth. I believe that Oedipus made many incorrect choices leading to his path of finding the truth.</P>
			 
	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;As a person who is a part of this kingdom, I believe that many of our problems could’ve been avoided if someone had advised King Oedipus to make better decisions. I understand that he was adamant about learning the truth about his father and the reason for his birth, but as a result, he caused tremendous problems and spread war throughout Thebes. Everyone has personal problems in their lives but as the King of our kingdom Oedipus’ duty was to put everything aside and make his kingdom his number one priority. This didn’t happen and it caused civil war resulting in even more conflict. </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Oedipus is a very determined person and that is why the constant theme of persistence in finding the truth is shown greatly throughout his journey. From the beginning of Oedipus Rex, he determines that he will seek out King Laius' killer. Oedipus spends the majority of the play searching for the culprit, even though Tiresias told him that it was Oedipus himself who committed the murder. Finally, near the end of the story, Oedipus discovers enough evidence to figure out the truth on his own. </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Another theme that is shown evidently throughout Oedipus’ journey is the power fate holds whereas the way free will can turn someone's life. I believe that the Oracle of Delphi was incorrect and Oedipus’ decision to continue on this personal journey brought tremendous downfall to the entire kingdom. Oedipus’ past was important for his own life but as a citizen of Thebes, I can confidently speak on the behalf of the people of Thebes and say there were multiple negative consequences as rumors spread of the Oracle of Delphi. </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;The main conflict in this play is between Fate and Free Choice. Uncontrollable forces such as fate exist. It was thought that a person's life was predetermined before birth. Zeus himself could not resist his own will due to how strong fate is. Nonetheless, the Greeks also placed a great deal of value on the idea of free choice. Oedipus' prophecy consequently "self-fulfills" itself. During the journey, he has complete freedom to decide how to behave. Ironically, Oedipus ends up experiencing the tragic outcome of his decisions. </p>
	
	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
	In conclusion, the journey of Oedipus with him finding the truth about what happened to his father has many pathways. The major themes and morals shown throughout his story were the impact of fate and free will throughout one's life, and how persistence in finding the truth can change the way a family is oriented.
