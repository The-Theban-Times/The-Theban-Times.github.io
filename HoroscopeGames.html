<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'"> &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Oedipus is characterized as an Aries, as he can be seen as very quick-tempered, and impatient. Aries are notorious for driving people away, and in the process can hurt themselves. Throughout the plot, we see people like Tiresias and Jocasta driven away from Oedipus. We see that Oedipus tends to quickly jump to conclusions which even led him to suspect that Tiresias took part in murdering his father Laius. After Jocasta found out that Oedipus was her son, it led her to kill herself. Oedipus was so shaken by this that he gouged his eyes out using his own mother’s brooch. This discovery of Oedipus’ heritage factored towards Creon’s decision to exile him from Thebes. All these characteristics of Oedipus, resemble those of an Aries, and he was destined for a life of solitude and tragedy. </p>

			<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;A motif is a recurring structure in a story that shows up several times and has a symbolic importance to the theme. There are multiple motifs shown throughout the story of Oedipus the King. Due to the fact that motifs are shown frequently throughout the text, they aren’t subtle and help build the overall structure of the story. Motifs throughout Oedipus’ journey are sight and blindness, illness and self-harm, and crossroads or choices. There are several smaller motifs that are expressed in this story but these three have the most notable effect. </p>

			<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the major motifs in this play is sight and blindness. This motif is shown to emphasize meaning in both a literal and figurative way. Clear vision is used as a metaphor for knowledge which is held superior to anything else. References to eyesight and insight in this play form an important pattern in combination with metaphorical meanings. Oedipus is famed for his clear-sightedness and quick comprehension, but there is irony to this situation when Oedipus finds out that he has been oblivious, and in a way blinded from knowing the truth for many years. At the end of the play, Oedipus is shown tearing his eyes out, this has a significant effect on the story by emphasizing the drastic causes of Oedipus not being able to “see” the truth. Another character in this play is Tiresias. Tiresias is blind, yet he sees farther than others and demonstrates remarkable powers of intellectual penetration. Sight and Blindness are mentioned multiple times throughout the text and have become a motif of this story.</p>

			<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Illness and suicide are mentioned multiple times throughout this story and have become motifs as well. There and multiple deaths throughout Oedipus the King but one of the most memorable is Joacasta’s. Jocasta’s death was due to suicide, she hangs herself in order to flee from the stress she was feeling. Her stress comes from being ashamed of having an intimate relationship with her son Oedipus. Jocasta believes that Oedipus has a misunderstanding and takes her life as a result. Another time self-harm was shown during the play when Oedipus inflicts horrible violence upon himself at the end of the play. As previously mentioned, Oedipus violently removes his eyes putting him through a severe amount of pain. The storyline of Oedipus also revolves around burials, and beliefs of how people should be buried when they pass away. As shown at the end of Oedipus the King, Oedipus cannot remain in Thebes or be buried within its territory. Oedipus’ actions caused him to be looked down upon by the gods and people of Thebes, as a result, he wasn’t able to be buried inside Thebes. Essentially, death and burials go hand in hand. Death and illness was extremely common at this time in the kingdom of Thebes therefore, there were more uses for burials. </p>
	
			<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;The mention of crossroads is what drives Oedipus’ journey. It is the first clue that he needed to figure out that he may have killed Laius, and it continues to reappear throughout the play. The motif of crossroads and choices however has more to do with than just Laius’ death, it is mentioned in other situations as well. The symbolism of crossroads is used to emphasize that Oedipus’ choices are what will shape the entire story. Although, in terms of killing Laius, Oedipus didn’t have a choice, and it caused a domino effect to occur. Oedipus’ fate is something that he had no control over, and as a result, his decision-making only can change the extent of it.  </p>
			<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; In conclusion, there are multiple motifs throughout the play Oedipus the King and these are just a few of them. Motifs play a significant role in influencing the reader or viewers interpretation of the text. </p>
