			Oedipus Rex the now-former king of Thebes has had his tragic past unfolded before his eyes. By the words of the prophetic Tiresias “ A deadly footed, double striking curse, from father and mother both, shall drive you forth from this land, with darkness on your eyes”.  </P>
				

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Oedipus’s name turns out to have a strange meaning, swollen foot, which unfortunately is an eerie foreshadowing. Oedipus Rex the now-former king of Thebes has had his tragic past unfolded before his eyes. By the words of the prophetic Tiresias “ A deadly footed, double striking curse, from father and mother both, shall drive you forth from this land, with darkness on your eyes”. It was so nerve-wracking that Tiresias' foreshadowing came true and Oedipus purposely blinded himself and abandoned his kingdom. Oedipus knew only bits and pieces of his origins but yesterday it became crystal clear and it was something of his nightmares.</P>
			 
	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;The story that everybody knows was that Oedipus was the Prince of Corinth, son of Polybus and Merope. He had left his kingdom in hopes of not fulfilling a dreadful prophecy: he was to kill his father and sleep with his mother. On his journey of escape, he met a man that provoked him and then killed him. At this time Thebes was mourning the death of our King Laius and faced the wrath of the Sphinx.  Finally, Oedipus arrived at Thebes and solved the great riddle which led the Sphinx to kill herself and free us. There, he became our new king, married the widowed queen Jocasta and had four children.  </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday, a messenger came to the palace bearing news of the death of Polybus Oedipus’s father. Oedipus was sad but also relieved that it was not him that killed his father as the prophecy had stated. Unfortunately, these thoughts were shaken when, in an effort to cheer the king up, the messenger told Oedipus that Polybus was not his true father. He had taken a baby from a shepherd and given it to the royal family as they had no sons.  </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;To solve the mystery he found the shepherd and what he said shook him. The shepherd confirmed the truth that Oedipus was the son of Laius. From there Oedipus connected the dots, and once again the words of Tiresias and the prophecy came true. “'I say that you are the murderer you are seeking”, he was the murderer of King Laius and his very own father. From there on, Oedipus's past was revealed. </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Oedipus was the son of his wife Jocasta and the former King of Thebes Laius. Laius and Jocasta had heard about the prophecy of their son killing his father and ruining the bed of his mother. To try and  stop this curse, Laius had the baby chained to a mountainside which left him with swollen feet which was his name sake. A shepherd freed him and gave him to the messenger of Polybus, who took him as the King had no sons. Oedipus was raised in Corinth with Polybus and Merope but he soon found out about the prophecy. In an effort to save his family, he left Corinth. On his escape, he ended up killing king Laius accidentally as he felt provoked by him. He arrived in Thebes, solved the riddle of the Sphinx, became King of Thebes, and married Jocasta. Foreshadowing plays a major role in Oedipus’ past because Oedipus was given hints about his story and it ended up creating suspense. It ensures the story is more uniquely interesting but also predictable. To be honest the prophecy gave a good guess as to what really could have happened. In addition Tiresias predicted the day's events correctly. He ended up killing his true father, sleeping with his true mother, and as hard as they tried to stop the prophecy it found its way of coming true.</p>
