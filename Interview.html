			<td style=" font-weight :Bold">Interview with Creon 
			<p style=" font-weight :Bold"><i> By Dishita Gupta </i></p>
			<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">
			The Theban Times get an exclusive interview with Creon, who is the brother of Jocasta and Oedipus's advisor as well. Get exclusive details like who he is, what is his past, present future.</P>
				

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'"> Interviewer: Hello people of Thebes, today we are here with Creon. Why don’t you tell us something about yourself before we start? </p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Creon: Thank you for asking, I am so excited to tell you about myself first. I was born in the glorious city of Thebes I was a very cute ba-</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Interview: Sorry, to cut you off there but what I meant was for you to introduce yourself to all of our audience. </p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Creon: Of course, I am the brother of Jocasta, oh my sweet sister Jocasta I will miss her forever. May she rest with the gods. Anyways I got sidetracked. I am also the trusted advisor to the king of Thebes. I am a rational and pragmatic person who values law and order and is committed to the well-being of Thebes. I am respected by the people of Thebes, and I serve as a voice of reason and moderation.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Interviewer: Thank you for sharing! On to the first question, and it is the question of the hour. How was, and is your relationship with Oedpius?</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Creon: Well, at the start Oedipus and I had a cordial relationship, with me serving as his trusted advisor. However our relationship deteriorates after Oedipus accuses me of conspiring against him. Even after Oedpius had accused me of conspiring to take his crown. I had explained to him in a very calm and collected tone why I had done absolutely nothing let alone have any interest in it.  I could have gotten mad and been as short tempered as my brother in-law/nephew but I explained my views without losing my temper.  Despite our differences, I still have a sense of loyalty towards the king and work towards the greater good of Thebes.</p>


<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Interviewer: I am so sorry for your loss. If you don’t mind, as our last activity we have organized  a fun exercise for our audience to get to know you better, why don’t you tell us three words that describe you?</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'"> Creon: As I said before, I am loyal to the king of Thebes and serve him dutifully as his trusted advisor. Next, I am also rational as I approach problems logically and with a clear head. In addition I am responsible as I take my roles very seriously.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Interview: That actually brings me to my next question, did you feel like you changed in any way after these crazy events unfolded around you?</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Creon: The answer is yes to say the least.  I went through significant changes throughout the situation. Initially, I was loyal and trustworthy to the king. However, as time progressed, I became embroiled in the conflict between Oedipus and the prophet Tiresias. I was accused of conspiring against Oedipus, and my relationship with the king became irreparably damaged.As a result of recent events , I am forced to take on the role of king after Oedipus gouged out his own eyes and was exiled from Thebes. I now have to rule this kingdom, and in a way bring it back from the shame Oedpius has caused us.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Interviewer: I am so sorry that you have to go through this. Is there anything else you would like to tell us about yourself before we end this interview, anything new you are up to?</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Creon: I think I pretty much covered everything, the only thing I strive to accomplish is for our kingdom to have stability once again.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Interview: Alright well there you have it folks Creon who was the advisor to Oedpius! Catch us next time, with a brand new guest!</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Creon: Thank you for this interview!</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Interviewer: Thank you, Creon, it was my pleasure.</p>
