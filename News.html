<!--<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Last night, in the royal palace a series of tragic events unfolded in a single day. This ended up with our cunning King Oedipus blinded and abandoning his kingdom, beloved Queen Jocasta dead, and ambiguity in the air, leaving his children orphaned. This series of events leaves many questions for his subjects: Who will rule? Are they qualified? What really unfolded and why? </P>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; The story starts after Oedipus is enraged by the results of the prophecy given to him by the soothsayer Tiresias. He was suggested to send for Tiresias by Creon to resolve the plague on our land. He was blinded by his rage and believes that his brother-in-law Creon sent Tiresias in an effort to kill him and take the throne. Creon of course thought this opinion was foolish and selfish and led to Queen Jocasta having to step in. She explained to him that he should not trust Tiresias and not be angered by Creon. It seems that Oedipus' thoughts may be caused by his ill temper. </p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; There was one thing that Tiresias said that resonated with Oedipus. He needed to find the person who killed our late king Laius. The only problem was that the details of Laius’ death were still misty. He had gone on a trip and was killed at the three-way crossroads just before the timely arrival of Oedipus. Unfortunately, Tiresias and Jocasta’s advice subtly hinted that it was Oedipus who killed the king. Oedipus had left his family at Corinth and had killed a man along the way as an act of self-defense. What if that man was our beloved king Laius?</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Hoping that he wasn’t the murderer of the king of his kingdom he wanted to search for the shepherd who had survived the murder scene but was discouraged by Jocasta. Later on, a messenger came to deliver some bad news to Oedipus, his father, Polybus had died. Oedipus was sad but in an effort to cheer him up the messenger revealed that Polybus and Merope of Corinth were not in fact his true parents. He was given to the messenger by Laius’s very own servant. Oedipus decided he wanted to find this servant but Jocasta pleaded with him not to. He ignored her and proceeded. The story seemed to have troubled Jocasta and she left the scene frustrated. </p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; As it turns out both shepherds Laius was looking for were the same person. He begged the shepherd for answers to his questions and he discovered a truth that shocked him. The baby he gave to the messenger was the son of Laius. That meant that he was the son of Laius. After unveiling this truth Oedipus fled to the palace where he found an unsightly scene.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Oedipus opened the locked bedroom door of his wife. From a noose was her limp body miserably hanging lifeless. He embraced the body and he was overwhelmed with hate and guilt for his actions. He felt that the gods believed he did not deserve a fate so kind as death. He unpinned the broach from Jocasta’s robe and stabbed his eyes, cursing himself with the fate of blindness for eternity. He ran out into public with his damaged eyes. He told Creon that his sons would rule the kingdom but he cared for his daughters. Oedipus made sure he was exiled from Thebes and his whereabouts were unknown.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Former Oedipus the King blind, he and his family were publicly shamed, and  the kingdom abandoned. He revealed a story so tragic and blasphemous, setting another curse on this kingdom. He left his sons who are still young to rule our kingdom. </p>


<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Who knows what will happen next, will the gods ever grant us peace?</p>-->

			<p style="font-weight:normal">
			Oedipus Rex the now-former king of Thebes has had his tragic past unfolded before his eyes. By the words of the prophetic Tiresias “ A deadly footed, double striking curse, from father and mother both, shall drive you forth from this land, with darkness on your eyes”.

			 <!-- <p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Oedipus Rex the now-former king of Thebes has had his tragic past unfolded before his eyes. By the words of the prophetic Tiresias “ A deadly footed, double striking curse, from father and mother both, shall drive you forth from this land, with darkness on your eyes”. It was so nerve-wracking that Tiresias' foreshadowing came true and Oedipus purposely blinded himself and abandoned his kingdom. Oedipus knew only bits and pieces of his origins but yesterday it became crystal clear and it was something of his nightmares.</P>
			 
	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;The story that everybody knows was that Oedipus was the Prince of Corinth, son of Polybus and Merope. He had left his kingdom in hopes of not fulfilling a dreadful prophecy: he was to kill his father and sleep with his mother. On his journey of escape, he met a man that provoked him and then killed him. At this time Thebes was mourning the death of our King Laius and facing the wrath of the Sphinx.  Finally, Oedipus arrived at Thebes and solved the great riddle which led the Sphinx to kill herself and free us. There he became our new king, married the widowed queen Jocasta and had four children. </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday, a messenger came to the palace bearing news of the death of Polybus Oedipus’s father. Oedipus was sad but also relieved that it was not him that killed his father as the prophecy had stated. Unfortunately, these thoughts were shaken when, in an effort to cheer the king up, the messenger told Oedipus that Polybus was not his true father. He had taken a baby from a shepherd and given it to the royal family as they had no sons. </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;To solve the mystery he found the shepherd and what he said shook him. The shepherd confirmed the truth that Oedipus was the son of Laius. From there Oedipus connected the dots, and once again the words of Tiresias and the prophecy come true “'I say that you are the murderer you are seeking”, he was the murderer of King Laius and his very own father. From there on, Oedipus's past was revealed.</p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Oedipus was the son of his wife Jocasta and the former King of Thebes Laius. Laius and Jocasta had heard about the prophecy of their son killing his father and ruining the bed of his mother. To try and  stop this curse, they sent the baby with a shepherd. The messenger of Polybus found the baby and took him as the King had no sons. Oedipus was raised in Corinth with Polybus and Merope but he soon found out about the prophecy. In an effort to save his family, he left Corinth. On his escape, he ended up killing king Laius accidentally as he felt provoked by him. He arrived in Thebes, solved the riddle of the Sphinx, became King of Thebes, and married Jocasta. He killed his true father, slept with his true mother, and as hard as the prophecy tried to be stopped it found its way of coming true.</p>-->
