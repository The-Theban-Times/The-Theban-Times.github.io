<!-- <p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'"> Interviewer: Hello people of Thebes, today we are here with Creon. Why don’t you tell us something about yourself before we start? </p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Creon: Thank you for asking, I am so excited to tell you about myself first. I was born in the glorious city of Thebes I was a very cute ba-</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Interview: Sorry, to cut you off there but what I meant was for you to introduce yourself to all of our audience. </p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Creon: Of course, I am the brother of Jocasta, oh my sweet sister Jocasta I will miss her forever. May she rest with the gods. Anyways I got sidetracked. I am also the trusted advisor to the king of Thebes. I am a rational and pragmatic person who values law and order and is committed to the well-being of Thebes. I am respected by the people of Thebes, and I serve as a voice of reason and moderation.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Interviewer: Thank you for sharing! On to the first question, and it is the question of the hour. How was, and is your relationship with Oedpius?</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Creon: Well, at the start Oedipus and I had a cordial relationship, with me serving as his trusted advisor. However our relationship deteriorates after Oedipus accuses me of conspiring against him. Even after Oedpius had accused me of conspiring to take his crown. I had explained to him in a very calm and collected tone why I had done absolutely nothing let alone have any interest in it.  I could have gotten mad and been as short tempered as my brother in-law/nephew but I explained my views without losing my temper.  Despite our differences, I still have a sense of loyalty towards the king and work towards the greater good of Thebes.</p>


<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Interviewer: I am so sorry for your loss. If you don’t mind, as our last activity we have organized  a fun exercise for our audience to get to know you better, why don’t you tell us three words that describe you?</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'"> Creon: As I said before, I am loyal to the king of Thebes and serve him dutifully as his trusted advisor. Next, I am also rational as I approach problems logically and with a clear head. In addition I am responsible as I take my roles very seriously.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Interview: That actually brings me to my next question, did you feel like you changed in any way after these crazy events unfolded around you?</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Creon: The answer is yes to say the least.  I went through significant changes throughout the situation. Initially, I was loyal and trustworthy to the king. However, as time progressed, I became embroiled in the conflict between Oedipus and the prophet Tiresias. I was accused of conspiring against Oedipus, and my relationship with the king became irreparably damaged.As a result of recent events , I am forced to take on the role of king after Oedipus gouged out his own eyes and was exiled from Thebes. I now have to rule this kingdom, and in a way bring it back from the shame Oedpius has caused us.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Interviewer: I am so sorry that you have to go through this. Is there anything else you would like to tell us about yourself before we end this interview, anything new you are up to?</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Creon: I think I pretty much covered everything, the only thing I strive to accomplish is for our kingdom to have stability once again.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Interview: Alright well there you have it folks Creon who was the advisor to Oedpius! Catch us next time, with a brand new guest!</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Creon: Thank you for this interview!</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">Interviewer: Thank you, Creon, it was my pleasure.</p>-->

			<td  style="width:50%">The Ironic Life of The King of Thebes
			<p style=" font-weight :Bold"><i> By Saanvi Muthuchetty </i></p>
			<p style="font-weight:normal">
			The life of Oedipus was a very intricate, and ironic one. Much so that it could be told in the form of a story. Many of the major events in Oedipus’ life are examples of dramatic irony as the audience knows of Oedipus’ origins while Oedipus is still oblivious to his true identity. 
			</p>
			<button class="collapsible"><a href="IronicLife.html">Read More</button>
			<div class="content">
			 <p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;It was so nerve-wracking that Tiresias' foreshadowing came true and Oedipus purposely blinded himself and abandoned his kingdom. Oedipus knew only bits and pieces of his origins but yesterday it became crystal clear and it was something of his nightmares.</P>
			 
	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;The story that everybody knows was that Oedipus was the Prince of Corinth, son of Polybus and Merope. He had left his kingdom in hopes of not fulfilling a dreadful prophecy: he was to kill his father and sleep with his mother. On his journey of escape, he met a man that provoked him and then killed him. At this time Thebes was mourning the death of our King Laius and facing the wrath of the Sphinx.  Finally, Oedipus arrived at Thebes and solved the great riddle which led the Sphinx to kill herself and free us. There he became our new king, married the widowed queen Jocasta and had four children. </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday, a messenger came to the palace bearing news of the death of Polybus Oedipus’s father. Oedipus was sad but also relieved that it was not him that killed his father as the prophecy had stated. Unfortunately, these thoughts were shaken when, in an effort to cheer the king up, the messenger told Oedipus that Polybus was not his true father. He had taken a baby from a shepherd and given it to the royal family as they had no sons. </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;To solve the mystery he found the shepherd and what he said shook him. The shepherd confirmed the truth that Oedipus was the son of Laius. From there Oedipus connected the dots, and once again the words of Tiresias and the prophecy come true “'I say that you are the murderer you are seeking”, he was the murderer of King Laius and his very own father. From there on, Oedipus's past was revealed.</p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Oedipus was the son of his wife Jocasta and the former King of Thebes Laius. Laius and Jocasta had heard about the prophecy of their son killing his father and ruining the bed of his mother. To try and  stop this curse, they sent the baby with a shepherd. The messenger of Polybus found the baby and took him as the King had no sons. Oedipus was raised in Corinth with Polybus and Merope but he soon found out about the prophecy. In an effort to save his family, he left Corinth. On his escape, he ended up killing king Laius accidentally as he felt provoked by him. He arrived in Thebes, solved the riddle of the Sphinx, became King of Thebes, and married Jocasta. He killed his true father, slept with his true mother, and as hard as the prophecy tried to be stopped it found its way of coming true.</p>
