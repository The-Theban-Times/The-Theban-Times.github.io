<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;The life of Oedipus was a very intricate, and ironic one. Much so that it could be told in the form of a story. Many of the major events in Oedipus’ life are examples of dramatic irony as the audience knows of Oedipus’ origins while he is still oblivious to his true identity. His story begins with the moment he was born. Oedipus was born to Queen Jocasta and King Laius of Thebes. It was told that Lauis was cursed and that his son would one day kill him, and marry his wife. All the decisions made by Oedipus throughout his life were to thwart the fulfillment of this prophecy from coming true but the consequences of those choices are well-known to everyone in Thebes. </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;When he decided to go to Thebes to protect his supposed “parents” in Corinth, it actually led him into traveling to his true parents and fulfilling the prophecy. Throughout Oedipus’ life, he searches for the murderer and even goes to the extent of swearing an oath to find and banish the person from the city. He would have never made such a promise if he had realized that he was the one who committed the murder. These are examples of situational irony.  </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Another moment is when Oedipus says, “My murder and the filcher of my crown? Come, answer this, didst thou detect in me some touch of cowardice or witlessness, that made thee undertake this enterprise?” He accuses Creon of killing Lauis which is dramatic because Oedipus is the true murderer. In the story, there is a major conflict between Tiresias and the King of Thebes. The ironic aspect of their relationship is that Tiresias is a blind man who can perceive the truth clearly while Oedipus, who has sight, is not able to determine the truth despite it being right in front of him. When Tiresias refuses to tell Oedipus the true murderer, the king calls the prophet blind even though he is the one blinded to the truth. This moment displays verbal irony. </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;In the conversation between Jocasta and Oedipus, Jocasta told him the story of her son whom she left to die on a mountain. As obvious as it was, Oedipus failed to recognize the connection which is dramatically ironic because Oedipus was the baby whom she abandoned. Another moment between the couple was when Jocasta realized that she was his mother. The queen begged Oedipus not to continue looking into Laius’ murder. She told him that he was “...born to suffer, born to misery and grief.” Unable to deal with the guilt, and the horrible situation Oedipus was put in, Jocasta killed herself. Oedipus however interpreted Jocasta’s statement in a completely different manner and believed that Jocasta thought of him as “lower birth” and was ashamed of her husband. In reality, this was false and verbally ironic since Oedipus carried royal blood and was not one of poverty.</p>
	
	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, the use of irony throughout the story creates a sense of foreboding. The anticipation of Oedipus’ realization that he is the murderer adds to the suspense because no one can predict what will happen once Oedipus figures out the identity of the killer. The entire tale of Oedipus’ lifetime is an example of irony because it revolves around his quest to discover the murderer, and how in the end he realized the true murderer was none other than himself.</p>
