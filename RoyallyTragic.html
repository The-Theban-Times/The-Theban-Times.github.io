<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Last night, in the royal palace a series of tragic events unfolded in a single day. This ended up with our cunning King Oedipus blinded and abandoning his kingdom, beloved Queen Jocasta dead, and ambiguity in the air, leaving his children orphaned. The same Oedipus who used his intelligence to solve the riddle of the Great Sphinx and free our people. This series of events leaves many questions for his subjects: Who will rule? Are they qualified? What really unfolded and why? </P>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; The story starts after Oedipus is enraged by the results of the prophecy given to him by the soothsayer Tiresias. He was suggested to send for Tiresias by Creon to resolve the plague on our land. He was blinded by his rage and believed that his brother-in-law Creon sent Tiresias in an effort to kill him and take the throne. Creon of course thought this opinion was foolish and selfish and led to Queen Jocasta having to step in. She explained to him that he should not trust Tiresias and not be angered by Creon. It seems that Oedipus' thoughts may be caused by his ill temper.  </p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; There was only one thing that Tiresias said that resonated in Oedipus’ stubborn mind. He needed to find the person who killed our late king Laius. The only problem was that the details of Laius’ death were still misty. He had gone on a trip and was killed at the three-way crossroads just before the timely arrival of Oedipus. Unfortunately, Tiresias and Jocasta’s advice subtly hinted that it was Oedipus who killed the king. Oedipus had left his family at Corinth and had killed a man along the way as an act of self-defense. What if that man was our beloved king Laius?</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Hoping that he wasn’t the murderer of the king of his kingdom he wanted to search for the shepherd who had survived the murder scene but was discouraged by Jocasta. Later on, a messenger came to deliver some bad news to Oedipus, his father, Polybus had died. Oedipus was sorrowful, but in an effort to cheer him up the messenger revealed that Polybus and Merope of Corinth were not in fact his true parents. He was given to the messenger by Laius’s very own servant. Oedipus decided he wanted to find this servant but Jocasta pleaded with him not to. He ignored her and proceeded. The story seemed to have troubled Jocasta and she left the scene frustrated. Oedipus may be very intelligent but it seemed as if his hope was blinding him. He did not connect the dots as his wife had.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; As it turns out both shepherds Laius was looking for were the same person. He begged the shepherd for answers to his questions and he discovered a truth that shocked him. The baby he gave to the messenger was the son of Laius. That meant that he was the son of Laius. After unveiling this truth Oedipus fled to the palace where he found an unsightly scene. Oedipus opened the locked bedroom door of his wife. From a noose was her limp body miserably hanging lifeless. He embraced the body and he was overwhelmed with hate and guilt for his actions. His righteous personality led him to feel that the gods believed he did not deserve a fate so kind as death. He unpinned the broach from Jocasta’s robe and stabbed his eyes, cursing himself with the fate of blindness for eternity. He ran out into public with his damaged eyes. He told Creon that his sons would rule the kingdom but he cared for his daughters. Oedipus made sure he was exiled from Thebes and his whereabouts are still unknown.</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Former Oedipus the King blind, he and his family were publicly shamed, and the kingdom abandoned. His stubbornness and hope kept him together throughout the day but in the end he revealed a story so tragic and blasphemous, setting another curse on this kingdom. He left his sons who are still young to rule our kingdom. </p>

<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Who knows what will happen next, will the gods ever grant us peace?</p>
