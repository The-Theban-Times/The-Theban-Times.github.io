<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;The people of Thebes are sad to announce the death of a very important member of the royal family: Jocasta. She was many things, The Queen of Thebes, the spouse and mother of King Oedipus, and the widow of King Laius. All of the queen’s troubles began when she married the cursed Prince Laius. He was destined to die at the hand of his son, who would later marry his wife. </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout her life, Jocasta projected herself as a distrustful person, especially when it came to the case of oracles and prophets. When Jocasta had a child, Laius received the prophecy that his son would murder him and would marry Jocasta. As a result, the couple left their baby to die on a mountainside, and this baby grew up to be Oedipus. Years later, Jocasta began to believe that she murdered her innocent child without reason, thinking that Lauis was killed by a gang of thieves. However, as the plot progressed, Jocasta realized that the prophecy foretold was indeed true. Their son turned out to be the murderer of Laius, and the husband of Jocasta. Even a puissant queen like Jocasta was unable to escape the great power of fate. </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Queen Jocasta was a very caring person. Although the action of leaving her son to die appeared to be cruel, she deeply regretted it later on. Jocasta was very loving towards Oedipus. She played the figure of his mother, as well as his wife. Jocasta and Oedipus’ relationship was one built on the foundation of love. The queen always showed patience when it came to him, and never once raised her voice. When Creon and Oedipus argued over the murder of Laius, Jocasta supported her husband instead of Creon, who was her brother. Even when Tiresias accused Oedipus of Laius' murderer, Jocasta went to the extent of saying that the gods could have made a mistake in the prophecy, just to pacify him. </p>

	<p style="font-weight:normal; font-size: 12; font-family:'Times New Roman'">&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; She has many layers as part of her personality. She can be seen as a cruel person, as well as a loving person. Jocasta is seen as a very dynamic person. There is a dramatic change in her personality and characteristics from the beginning to the end of her lifetime. When the queen married Oedipus, she always supported him in anything that he did. That included investigating the murder of her previous husband Laius. She was also very patient and never yelled at Oedipus. However, when Jocasta realizes that Oedipus is her son and that she did indeed have his children, she undergoes a dramatic change. Jocasta pleads, and in a way commands Oedipus not to look into Lauis’ murder. From a patient and loving wife, she changed into a guilty, and desperate mother. Jocasta was an inspiring, and powerful woman, but even she had her limits. At the end unable to deal with the guilt crushing her down, The Queen of Thebes hung herself with bed sheets, symbolizing the incest that had occurred.
